<h2>Jokic’s Brilliance Overshadowed</h2>
<p>Once again, <strong>Nikola Jokic</strong> put on a clinic — his passing, footwork, and touch were all elite. But it was all spoiled by <strong>Michael Porter Jr.’s disappearing act</strong>. MPJ couldn’t find a rhythm, and his cold shooting cost the Nuggets momentum.</p>

<h2>Where’s the Swagger, Shai?</h2>
<p><strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> has been solid this postseason, but fans are starting to wonder: where’s that MVP-caliber swagger from the regular season? He’s scoring — but he’s not commanding games like he used to. That must change if OKC wants to pull off the upset.</p>

<h2>Jamal Murray’s Vintage Third Quarter</h2>
<p>Murray erupted in the third — a reminder of his 2020 Bubble brilliance. But he cooled off down the stretch, and Denver couldn’t close. The Nuggets need full-game consistency from their backcourt to win the series.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>Unsung Hero Watch: Isiah Hartenstein</h2>
<p>Quietly, <strong>Isiah Hartenstein</strong> has been one of the best glue guys of the playoffs. His rebounding, interior presence, and hustle are key for the Knicks — and go beyond the box score.</p>
