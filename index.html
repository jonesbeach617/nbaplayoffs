<h2>Game 5: Knicks vs Celtics – Can New York Take Over?</h2>
<p><strong>Knicks fans are fired up</strong> for tonight’s crucial Game 5 matchup against the Celtics. But they might catch a break — <span class="highlight">Jayson Tatum is officially out with an Achilles injury</span>.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers still like Boston (-5.5), but don’t count out New York. The Garden will be electric.</p>
<p><strong>Bet of the Night:</strong> Knicks Moneyline.</p>
<p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong> Payton Pritchard. With Tatum out, Payton could step up like he did in Game 3. Also, look for Finals MVP Jaylen Brown to take on a massive load.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The winner of this series will face <strong>Tyrese Haliburton</strong> and the red-hot Pacers, who have quietly turned into a playoff buzzsaw. Can either Boston or New York keep up with their pace?</p>
